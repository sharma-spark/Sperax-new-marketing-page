            <span>Both the Sperax team and community are human-centric. Sperax's trajectory will be a function of the strength of our ideas and the quality of our execution. We believe that neither groundbreaking ideas nor great execution are found exclusively at higher levels of an organization, particularly ours. Most times, it is just the opposite. Sperax prides itself on being a meritocracy. We bet on talent and tenacityâ€¦ not titles.</span>
